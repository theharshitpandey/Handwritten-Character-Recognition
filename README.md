# Handwritten-Character-Recognition
This model predict handwritten alphabets/characters by analyzing an image.

Character Recognition using Data Visualization and Training is a software algorithm to recognize any hand written character by providing digital image as an input. 
The application of ‘Handwritten Character Recognition’ is extensive. 
We can use this as an interpreter or in various aspects where text recognition is used.
There is also a huge scope to extend this work forward for example the advanced version of this project can be used to recognize a word and then a complete sentence. 
Thus, this can be later used in applications like google lens (or similar), audio books, text reader, scanning documents, etc.
